Vision
------

### Original idea - 2012
Watch the [video-prototyping](http://vimeo.com/46923757) of the application as
it was envisioned in 2012.

### Present - sept. 2014
[adoptajerry](http://adoptajerry.cc) is a free software web application. The master branch is running in production.

### Future
adoptajerry is able to run on different servers. Each instance of the app have its own database that sync up and down to the database of reference. The application accessible at [adoptajerry.cc](http://adoptajerry.cc) is serving data from the database of reference.
The application remains free software under AGPLv3. And the content of the database might be distributed under an open data license such as the [Open Data Commons Open Database License \(ODbL\)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/). The choice of the license is something to be discussed within the JerryClan.

#### Example of use case
adoptajerry can run on an offline local network hosted on a Jerry Computer during a workshop. When the workshop is done, the instance is plugged to the internet and its database automatically synchronized to the database of reference.
